## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/saifyxpro/headlessx/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/saifyxpro/headlessx/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Code Style

- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

## Documentation

- Update documentation for any new features or API changes
- Include JSDoc comments for new functions and classes
- Update the README.md if needed

## Feature Requests

We track feature requests through GitHub issues. Before creating a new feature request:

1. Check if a similar request already exists
2. Clearly describe the problem you're trying to solve
3. Explain why this feature would be beneficial to the project
4. Consider if this is something that would benefit the broader community

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you
