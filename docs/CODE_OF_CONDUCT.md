## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:

* All project repositories and their associated resources
* Project documentation and wikis
* Issue trackers and discussion forums
* Social media channels and communications
* Project events and meetups
* Any other HeadlessX community spaces

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Primary Contact:** [project maintainer email]
**GitHub Issues:** For technical conduct violations, create a private issue
**GitHub Discussions:** For community discussions about conduct

### What to Include

When reporting, please provide:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
* Any additional information that may be helpful

### What Happens Next

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders will:
1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. Review the incident and gather additional information if needed
3. Determine appropriate action based on our enforcement guidelines
4. Communicate the outcome to the reporter
5. Follow up as necessary

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.

1. **Submitting an Appeal**: Contact the project maintainers within 30 days of the enforcement action
